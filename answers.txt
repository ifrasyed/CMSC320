Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git provides many features that make programming easier. It provides memory for code to be saved on. For example, in a case where you computer stops working, you will still have access to 
your repository. Another neat feature that Git has is branching will allows for independent work
that is easy to combine with other people's work.
